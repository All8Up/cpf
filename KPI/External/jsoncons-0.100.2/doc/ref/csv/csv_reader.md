### jsoncons::csv::csv_reader

The `csv_reader` class is an instantiation of the `basic_csv_reader` class template that uses `char` as the character type. It reads a [CSV file](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) and produces JSON parse events.

`csv_reader` is noncopyable and nonmoveable.

#### Header
```c++
#include <jsoncons_ext/csv/csv_reader.hpp>
```
#### Constructors

    csv_reader(std::istream& is,
               json_input_handler& handler)
Constructs a `csv_reader` that is associated with an input stream
`is` of CSV text and a [json_input_handler](json_input_handler.md) that receives
JSON events. Uses default [csv_parameters](csv_parameters.md).
You must ensure that the input stream and input handler exist as long as does `csv_reader`, as `csv_reader` holds pointers to but does not own these objects.

    csv_reader(std::istream& is,
               json_input_handler& handler,
               const csv_parameters& params)
Constructs a `csv_reader` that is associated with an input stream
`is` of CSV text, a [json_input_handler](json_input_handler.md) that receives
JSON events, and [csv_parameters](csv_parameters.md).
You must ensure that the input stream and input handler exist as long as does `csv_reader`, as `csv_reader` holds pointers to but does not own these objects.

    csv_reader(std::istream& is,
               json_input_handler& handler,
               parse_error_handler& err_handler)
Constructs a `csv_reader` that is associated with an input stream
`is` of CSV text, a [json_input_handler](json_input_handler.md) that receives
JSON events and the specified [parse_error_handler](parse_error_handler.md).
Uses default [csv_parameters](csv_parameters.md).
You must ensure that the input stream, input handler, and error handler exist as long as does `csv_reader`, as `csv_reader` holds pointers to but does not own these objects.

    csv_reader(std::istream& is,
               json_input_handler& handler,
               parse_error_handler& err_handler,
               const csv_parameters& params)
Constructs a `csv_reader` that is associated with an input stream
`is` of CSV text, a [json_input_handler](json_input_handler.md) that receives
JSON events, the specified [parse_error_handler](parse_error_handler.md),
and [csv_parameters](csv_parameters.md).
You must ensure that the input stream, input handler, and error handler exist as long as does `csv_reader`, as `csv_reader` holds pointers to but does not own these objects.

#### Member functions

    bool eof() const
Returns `true` when there is no more data to be read from the stream, `false` otherwise

    void read()
Reports JSON related events for JSON objects, arrays, object members and array elements to a [json_input_handler](json_input_handler.md), such as a [json_decoder](json_decoder.md).
Throws [parse_error](parse_error.md) if parsing fails.

    size_t buffer_length() const

    void buffer_length(size_t length)

### Examples

#### Reading a comma delimted file into an array of json values

#### Comma delimited input file 
```
country_code,name
ABW,ARUBA
ATF,"FRENCH SOUTHERN TERRITORIES, D.R. OF"
VUT,VANUATU
WLF,WALLIS & FUTUNA ISLANDS
```
Note 

- The first record contains a header line, but we're going to ignore that and read the entire file as an array of arrays.
- The third record has a field value that contains an embedded comma, so it must be quoted.

#### Code
```c++
std::string in_file = "countries.csv";
std::ifstream is(in_file);

json_decoder<json> decoder;

csv_reader reader(is,decoder);
reader.read();
json countries = decoder.get_result();

std::cout << pretty_print(countries) << std::endl;
```
#### Output 
```json
[
    ["country_code","name"],
    ["ABW","ARUBA"],
    ["ATF","FRENCH SOUTHERN TERRITORIES, D.R. OF"],
    ["VUT","VANUATU"],
    ["WLF","WALLIS & FUTUNA ISLANDS"]
]
```
#### Reading a tab delimted file into an array of json objects

#### Tab delimited input file
```
employee-no employee-name   dept    salary  note
00000001    Smith, Matthew  sales   150,000.00      
00000002    Brown, Sarah    sales   89,000.00       
00000003    Oberc, Scott    finance 110,000.00      
00000004    Scott, Colette  sales   75,000.00       """Exemplary"" employee
Dependable, trustworthy"
```
Note 

- The first record is a header line, which will be used to associate data values with names
- The fifth record has a field value that contains embedded quotes and a new line character, so it must be quoted and the embedded quotes escaped.

#### Code
```c++
std::string in_file = "employees.txt";
std::ifstream is(in_file);

json_decoder<json> decoder;
csv_parameters params;
params.field_delimiter = '\t'
      .assume_header = true;

csv_reader reader(is,decoder,params);
reader.read();
json employees = decoder.get_result();

std::cout << pretty_print(employees) << std::endl;
```

#### Output

```json
[
    {
        "dept":"sales",
        "employee-name":"Smith, Matthew",
        "employee-no":"00000001",
        "note":"",
        "salary":"150,000.00"
    },
    {
        "dept":"sales",
        "employee-name":"Brown, Sarah",
        "employee-no":"00000002",
        "note":"",
        "salary":"89,000.00"
    },
    {
        "dept":"finance",
        "employee-name":"Oberc, Scott",
        "employee-no":"00000003",
        "note":"",
        "salary":"110,000.00"
    },
    {
        "dept":"sales",
        "employee-name":"Scott, Colette",
        "employee-no":"00000004",
        "note":"\"Exemplary\" employee\nDependable, trustworthy",
        "salary":"75,000.00"
    }
]
```

#### Reading the comma delimited file as an array of objects with user supplied columns names

Note 

- The first record contains a header line, but we're going to ignore that and use our own names for the fields.

#### Code
```c++
std::string in_file = "countries.csv";
std::ifstream is(in_file);

json_decoder<json> decoder;

csv_parameters params;
params.column_names("Country Code,Name")
      .header_lines(1);

csv_reader reader(is,decoder,params);
reader.read();
json countries = decoder.get_result();

std::cout << pretty_print(countries) << std::endl;
```

#### Output 
```json
[
    {
        "Country Code":"ABW",
        "Name":"ARUBA"
    },
    {
        "Country Code":"ATF",
        "Name":"FRENCH SOUTHERN TERRITORIES, D.R. OF"
    },
    {
        "Country Code":"VUT",
        "Name":"VANUATU"
    },
    {
        "Country Code":"WLF",
        "Name":"WALLIS & FUTUNA ISLANDS"
    }
]
```

reader1.read();
ojson val1 = decoder.get_result();
std::cout << "\n(1)\n"<< pretty_print(val1) << "\n";

params.mapping(mapping_type::n_objects);
std::istringstream is2("bond_yields.csv");
